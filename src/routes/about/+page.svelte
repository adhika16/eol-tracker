      This project began as a personal tool to track the frameworks I use daily. After finding it helpful, I decided to share it so others can benefit from easily monitoring framework lifecycles and staying informed.
      <br /><br />
      Framework lifecycle data is provided by the excellent <a href="https://endoflife.date/docs/api" class="underline text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EndOfLife API</a>.
